Neurodesk Play
- Recommended for quick access and trialling
- No login or sign-up required (except for AAF authentication at the Australian Play server)
- Files and sessions are deleted after exiting
- Does **NOT** preserve files from previous sessions
- only a limited number of instances are available and the CPU and RAM are limited as well. If you require more sessions or resources, it's possible to run a custom Neurodesk lab (https://lab.neurodesk.org). For more information, please get in touch: mail.neurodesk@gmail.com
